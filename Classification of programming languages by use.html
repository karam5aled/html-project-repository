<h2>Classification of programming languages by use:</h2>
   There are several areas in which programming languages are included, and
each field has its uses and goals, programming is involved in the development of
programs and applications, as well as in the development of databases, video game
development, identification programs, and so on. Examples of programming
languages used in many areas of the computer include:-
<ul>
<li>The field of applications and software: One of the programming languages used in
developing programs, including web browsers, for example: C, C #, and C ++.</li>
<li>The field of artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence enters in several fields,
such as: video games, chatbot programs, and others, and among the programming
languages that enter in this field is the language (AIML), in addition to the
language C, Prolog, and Python.</li>
<li>Database field: Programming languages are used in this field to create and modify
databases, and these languages are the language Sequoil and May Sequel, in
addition to DBASE.</li>
<li>The field of video games: Among the programming languages that enter in this
field and the field of various entertainment software is C, C #, C ++, and Java, in
addition to DarkBasek.</li>
<li>Website creation: One of the languages used in website development is HTML,
JavaScript, PHP, Python, XML, and Java.</li>
<li>Drivers: One of the programming languages used in the field of writing
identification programs for different devices is assembly language and C language.</li>
