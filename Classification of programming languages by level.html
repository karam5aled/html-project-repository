<h2>Classification of programming languages by level:</h2>
   Programming languages can be classified in terms of their level into low-level
programming languages, high-level programming languages, and the level here is
intended to be the extent to which the language is stripped and easily understood by
humans, the most abstract languages such as machine language are low-level
programming languages, and the closer the programming language is closer to the
machine language Its level is lower, since the machine language followed by the
assembly language is the lowest in the level. In the machine language, the commands
are written directly in the language that the computer understands, namely the
numbers, and in the assembly language, the commands are written in a way that is
slightly simpler than the machine language, so that A specific phrase for the matter is
written instead of writing with numbers, for example (MOV AL, 61h).
High-level programming languages are simpler and less abstract than low-level
languages, so the way to write and read is easier, and some of them may enable the
possibility of arranging the code in templates, in addition to keeping the values in
variables, creating functions, and so on. Through high-level programming languages,
a programmer can, by writing only one line, cause the computer to execute a large
number of commands.
Both low-level programming languages and high-level programming languages
have important benefits. The first gives the programmer greater control over his
program, such as organizing memory, storing data, etc., and programs written in lowlevel
languages are usually faster than others, but for high languages The level is
easier and simpler, and programming with these languages is safer. As these languages
include means of protection to prevent the programmer from harming the computer
in the event of a mistake in writing some commands.
