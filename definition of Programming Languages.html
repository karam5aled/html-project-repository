	<h2>definition of Programming Languages</h2>
programming language is a formal language which includes a collection of
instructions that produce different output types. The programming languages are
used to incorporate algorisms in computer programming.
Many programming languages consist of the machine instructions. There are
programmable machines that use a series of unique instructions instead of
programming languages generally. The early ones preceded the invention of the digital
machine, the first being possibly the automatic flute player mentioned during the
Islamic Golden Age by the Musa brothers in Baghdad in the 9th century. The
programs have been used since the early 1800s to control the action of machines such
as Jacquard looms, music boxes, and player pianos. The programs for these machines
(such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to
different inputs or conditions.
Thousands of different programming languages were created, and more are created
annually. Many programming languages are written in an imperative form (i.e. as a
sequence of operations to be performed) while other languages use the declarative
form (i.e. you specify the desired result, not how to achieve it).
Usually the description of a programming language is divided into the two components
of syntax (form) and semantics (sign). Many languages are specified by a standard
document (for example, an ISO Standard defines the programming language for C)
whereas other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is
regarded as a reference. Some languages have both common, with a standard defined
basic language, and extensions taken from the dominant implementation.
